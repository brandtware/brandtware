### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a pokemon go pvp teambuilding app called [Go Dexicon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.brandtware.godexicon) in C#/Xamarin Forms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity... at least sometimes ;p
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: try here? I am not a social networker
- âš¡ Fun fact: started coding with 8 years on a C64 and thought for-loops were for delays/timers ;p
